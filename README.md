# EUCLID-VECTOR-2024-01
Welcome to the **EUCLID-VECTOR/2024-01** project repository! ðŸŒ€ This project presents a revolutionary analysis of cosmic anisotropy, blending cutting-edge astronomy with an "embodied" approach rooted in real galaxy observations. Inspired by the spiral dance of the universe, we map primordial vector fields to uncover the cosmos's deepest secrets.
