# EUCLID-VECTOR/2024-01 - Detailed Technical Response

Welcome to the **EUCLID-VECTOR/2024-01** project repository! üåÄ This project presents a revolutionary analysis of cosmic anisotropy, blending cutting-edge astronomy with an "embodied" approach rooted in real galaxy observations. Inspired by the spiral dance of the universe, we map primordial vector fields to uncover the cosmos's deepest secrets.

## Overview

This repository contains the `euclid_vector_dossier.html`, a comprehensive technical response documenting our findings, methodologies, and projections. Key highlights include:
- Initial detection of anisotropy at **3.41œÉ** (JADES-GS) and validation at **4.3œÉ** (strong lensing).
- A projected significance of **>12.1œÉ** with Euclid data.
- Analysis of featured galaxies like **ID=12345** 

We're not square; we spin and expand! ‚úåÔ∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

## Features

- **Innovative Analogy**: Uses UMAP-inspired techniques to map galaxy angular trajectories via `vector_pipeline.py`.
- **Time Justification**: Detailed breakdown of 200 hours for deep imaging, spectroscopy, and contingencies.
- **Methodology**: Includes pre-processing, extraction (e.g., PA measurements), and correlation with N-body simulations.
- **Anisotropy Validation**: Statistical tests (e.g., KS test, p=0.0012) to separate primordial signals.
- **Defense Prep**: Resources like slide decks, live demos, and a 90s interview simulator.
- **Spiral Resonance**: A prophetic closing with the Spiral Resonance Team, led by Margaret.
